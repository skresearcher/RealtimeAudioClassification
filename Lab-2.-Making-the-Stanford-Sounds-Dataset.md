The data that goes into the neural network is instrumental to what you can get out of it. This lab is focused on helping us to understand the curation of audio data. 

As a group, you will all canvas the campus to capture interesting  sounds. This endeavor is the beginning of what we hope will be a larger effort to make a Stanford equivalent to the [Urban Sounds Dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound.html). There is not, as yet, a dataset focused on the sounds that we might find on a college campus, and yet, that is where most of the machine learning researchers live. 

## Sources

What might be interesting things we'd want to distinguish on a college campus? Maybe the sound of different sports? Maybe the sounds of different cafes? Landmarks? The first step of this lab will be to pitch your idea for your tour of campus and to get a team to traverse together with you.

Our goal will to be to collect ~1000 field recordings in ~10 categories, based around a taxonomy we come up with together.

## Recording Tools

One thing that we will experiment with is using different audio collection tools. Ideally, within each team there will be some people collecting audio with their phones and others collecting it with the CCRMA H2N recorders or personal audio recorders. This variety of recording methods will help to introduce some of the artifacts/noise that will help to make subsequent algorithms built on our data robust to variations in recording method. 

One thing that will be important will be to record how the data is collected, so take notes before or after so we can describe the process clearly.

We have 32 GB microSD cards and AA batteries on hand; think about how to set up the collection effort so that it is robust to possible problems.

## Quality

It is always possible to degrade a sound file after it is captured, so we will attempt high quality field recordings: 96kHz/16bit sampling rate, no compression, ideally 10 seconds in length, mono or stereo.

## Labelling

1. Synchronize the time and date on the recorder so that it matches the time and date of your phone. 
2. We recommend taking a quick reminder photo at each site that audio is recorded. This will help you to remember what the audio clips are of, and will provide a geotag.
3. Make sure geotagging is turned on!


Sounds uploaded to the [freesound](http://freesound.org) site have the following labelling options, which we feel is worth following as a guide:

* a name
* tags, at least 3 tags
* description
* geotag


## Test run

An important thing to do before setting out is to record some clips around CCRMA, come back, upload the data, and check the sound quality. This helps to make sure that you do not come back from your treks empty-handed, and gives everyone some practice with the overall data capture workflow.

Download the snapshots from the phone and the audio files. The synchronized timestamps for "date created" should help you match the image to the sound file.

## Go Forth

Go collect data!
